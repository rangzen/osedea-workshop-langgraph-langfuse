# Osedea Workshop on LangGraph and Langfuse

Event oriented programming or microservices are too easy to debug? You want randomness in your results?

You have it with agents!

---

## Goal of this workshop

Look into a simple agentic workflow built with LangGraph & introduce observability with Langfuse.

*Beware, this content will probably be outdated in 6 months...*

---

## What are Agents?

Agents are systems that use a Large Language Model (LLM) to **reason** through a problem, create a **plan**, and execute a sequence of **actions** to accomplish a **goal autonomously**. They can use **tools**, like search engines or code interpreters, to find information and perform tasks.

## A Simple Agentic Workflow

<div class="container">
<div class="col">
A basic agent follows a linear path from input to output. At it's core an agent will make a decision based on the context it has.

## Improving Model Behaviour

## The ReAct Pattern

<div class="container">
<div class="col">
ReAct (Reason + Act) is a common agentic pattern. Instead of a single decision, the agent loops through  a process of reasoning and acting until it reaches a final answer.

## What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a library from the LangChain team for building stateful, multi-agent applications. It allows you to define agent workflows as graphs, where nodes represent functions (or LLM calls) and edges represent the control flow between them.

This graph-based approach is particularly well-suited for creating the cyclical and complex logic required by agentic systems.

---

## LangGraph

Control flow (edges) and state updates (nodes).

## LangGraph Core Concepts

*   **State:** A central, persistent object that is passed between all nodes in the graph. Each node can update the state.
*   **Interruptions:** The graph can be paused at any point, for example, to wait for human input or to handle an error. This is essential for human-in-the-loop workflows.
*   **Checkpoints:** LangGraph can automatically save the state of the graph. This allows you to resume long-running tasks, recover from failures, and inspect the full history of an agent's work.

## LangGraph: Instrumented For Observability

A key advantage of using a framework like LangGraph is its built-in instrumentation. The framework is designed to emit telemetry data out-of-the-box.

By simply adding a callback handler from a tool like Langfuse, you can capture detailed traces of your agent's execution, making complex workflows easy to observe, debug, and optimize.

---

## What is Langfuse?

Langfuse is an open-source observability and analytics platform specifically designed for LLM applications. It helps you:

- **Trace** complex chains and agentic systems.
- **Debug** errors and unexpected outputs.
- **Evaluate** the quality and performance of your application.
- **Manage** prompts and versions.
